A custom **MTLLM** plugin that enables Jaclang's powerful `by llm()` workflow to run entirely on your local machine. This project provides a local server and an intelligent plugin to integrate and dynamically fine-tune a specialized **TinyLlama** model, offering a private, self-improving, and cost-effective alternative to cloud-based LLM services.

## ✨ Key Features

* **💻 Local-First Operation**: Run your entire LLM workflow offline. No API keys, no network latency, no data leaving your machine.
* **🧠 Dynamic Fine-Tuning**: The plugin can automatically trigger fine-tuning jobs based on usage, allowing the model to continuously learn and specialize for your specific tasks.
* **🔌 Seamless Integration**: Acts as a drop-in replacement for other MTLLM plugins. Use the familiar `by llm()` syntax in your Jaclang code without changes.
* **🔒 Privacy-Focused**: Your code, prompts, and data are processed locally, ensuring complete confidentiality.
* **🔧 Open & Customizable**: Based on powerful open-source tools like `llama.cpp` and `LiteLLM`, allowing for deep customization.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The plugin manages two core loops: a real-time inference loop for immediate requests and a background fine-tuning loop for continuous model improvement. All operations are orchestrated by the plugin, making it the central brain of the system.
